    <h1>Testimony of Evangelism</h1>

    <p>Hello. Do you know how this world was created? Just as every house has a builder, this world did not come into existence by itself; <strong>there is a Creator</strong>. This Creator made nature and humanity and saw that it was good. He desired a true fellowship with us. He loved us deeply, and we also loved Him.</p>

    <p>However, humanity became distant from God. God commanded us not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but humanity disobeyed His word and ate its fruit. As a result, humanity began to judge good and evil by its own standards rather than by God’s standards.</p>

    <p>We could no longer remain in heaven, where only those who are righteous by God’s standards can enter. God created not only the finite physical world but also the eternal spiritual realms of <strong>heaven and hell</strong>. Because of our sins, we were destined for hell.</p>

    <p>Despite this, God still loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus, who was with Him from the beginning, to this world to pay the price for our sins. Jesus endured suffering and pain and shed His blood on the cross to pay our debt.</p>

    <p><strong>Jesus rose from the dead on the third day</strong>, conquering sin and death. He gives us the hope that we too can be saved from sin and death through Him, and He proved that He is the Son of God. By believing in Jesus and opening the door of our hearts to invite Him in, He declares us righteous and makes us children of God.</p>

    <p>Some people come to believe in Jesus through dramatic experiences. However, in my case, over the course of 40 years of reading the Bible, my understanding of God’s existence and the love and grace of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross has gradually grown, and now it is undeniable. Even now, my life is continuously changing and drawing closer to God through the Bible. <strong>God is alive and loves me, loves us all very much.</strong></p>

    <p>Before knowing enough about Jesus, I was terribly afraid of death and the eternal punishment of hell. But after knowing Jesus more and more, I no longer fear death because I am now a child of God, and my eternal destiny is set in heaven.</p>

    <p>I used to live a life filled with worries about money and my children’s education, and so on. Now, I focus my life on Jesus and walk with the Holy Spirit, trusting that the Father in heaven will take care of His child, me. This is because 1) <strong>His love is so great</strong>, 2) <strong>He is very wise</strong>, and 3) <strong>He has enough power to give His child the best</strong>. Thank you, God. You are good. Thank you for listening.</p>
